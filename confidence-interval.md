# Confidence Intervals and Data Literacy

## Introduction
Confidence intervals are a fundamental concept in statistics that help us estimate a range within which a population parameter is likely to fall. In this section, we’ll explore what confidence intervals are, why they’re important for data literacy, and how to interpret them in real-world contexts.

## Understanding Confidence Intervals

### What Are Confidence Intervals?
A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the true population parameter. For example, when you hear that a survey has a "margin of error of ±3%," it’s describing a confidence interval.

### Why Are Confidence Intervals Important?
- **Quantifying Uncertainty**: They help us understand the uncertainty inherent in data.
- **Informed Decision-Making**: They allow decision-makers to account for variability when interpreting results.

## The Math Behind Confidence Intervals

The formula for a confidence interval is:
\[ CI = \bar{x} \pm Z \left(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) \]

Where:
- \( \bar{x} \): Sample mean
- \( Z \): Z-score corresponding to the confidence level
- \( \sigma \): Standard deviation
- \( n \): Sample size

## Visualizing Confidence Intervals

Visual representations, like error bars, make it easier to interpret confidence intervals. Below is an example of a visualization:

- **Graph 1**: A simple bar chart with confidence intervals
- **Graph 2**: A line graph showing changing intervals with varying sample sizes

## Interactive App

Explore confidence intervals with our interactive R app below:

### Features
1. Input your own dataset or use a sample dataset.
2. Adjust the confidence level (90%, 95%, 99%).
3. Visualize how confidence intervals change with sample size.

## Summary

Confidence intervals are a powerful tool in data analysis. They bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights, empowering us to make decisions with an understanding of uncertainty.
